# :scroll: Abstract
In this paper, we present TAPTRv2, a Transformer-based approach built upon TAPTR for solving the Tracking Any Point (TAP) task. TAPTR borrows designs from DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and formulates each tracking point as a point query, making it possible to leverage well-studied operations in DETR-like algorithms. TAPTRv2 improves TAPTR by addressing a critical issue regarding its reliance on cost-volume, which contaminates the point query’s content feature and negatively impacts both visibility prediction and cost-volume computation. In TAPTRv2, we propose a novel attention-based position update (APU) operation and use key-aware deformable attention to realize. For each query, this operation uses key-aware attention weights to combine their corresponding deformable sampling positions to predict a new query position. This design is based on the observation that local attention is essentially the same as cost-volume, both of which are computed by dot-production between a query and its surrounding features. By introducing this new operation, TAPTRv2 not only removes the extra burden of cost-volume computation, but also leads to a substantial performance improvement. TAPTRv2 surpasses TAPTR and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging datasets, demonstrating the superiority.

___TLDR___

1) According to our experiments and analysis, we find that __TAPTR’s reliance on the source-consuming cost-volume stems from the domain gap between training and evaluation data__.

2) Cost-Volume-Aggregation module in TAPTR not only introduces __extra burden of cost-volume computation__ (especially when the number of points, the length of videos, or the video resolution increases), but also __contaminate__ the point query's content feature. 

3) We find that the __attention weights and cost-volume are essentially the same__. Based on the observation we propose the __Attention-based Position Update (APU)__ module. 

4) TAPTRv2 no longer requires the source-consuming cost-volume, and its point queries are no longer contaminated, making it __simpler yet stronger__.
